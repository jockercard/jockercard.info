## Step 1: Google Search Console (IMPORTANT)

Google has most of the search traffic. You MUST add your site here:

1. Go to **https://search.google.com/search-console**
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click **Add property**
4. Enter your site URL (e.g. `https://your-domain.com`)
5. Verify ownership:
   - Choose **HTML tag** method
   - Copy the meta tag they give you
   - Add it to your index.html (ask for help if needed)
6. After verification: **Sitemaps** → Add sitemap → `sitemap.xml` → Submit
7. **URL Inspection** → Paste your URL → **Request indexing** (this asks Google to crawl your site ASAP)

3. **Sitemaps** → Submit sitemap URL: `https://your-domain.com/sitemap.xml`
4. **URL Submission** → Submit: `https://your-domain.com`

## Step 3: Be Patient

- **Google**: Can take 3–7 days to index; sometimes longer for new sites
- **Bing**: Often 1–2 weeks
- After indexing, ranking improves over time as the site gains visits and authority

## Step 4: Check If You're Indexed

**Google**: Search `site:your-domain.com` – if your page appears, you're indexed.

**Bing**: Search `site:your-domain.com` on bing.com.
